# teste-tecnico-CNPq

This project was part of a Python technical test. The main goal was to generate a phosphorous pollution map of water bodies across Brazil, and showcase it somehow.
Running python-map-generator/CNPqtest.py, it gathers data from /python-map-generator/agua_teste.csv with pandas and uses folium to build an html map.
This generated map is simply embedded inside index.html for better visualization.
